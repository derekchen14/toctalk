# Add Note-Taking Functionality to Quirkbot Interviewer Agent

## Instructions for Using This Document

1. Work in sequence: Complete phases in order (Phase 0 → Phase 1 → ...)
2. Mark progress: Use `- [x]` to mark completed subtasks
3. Fill Developer Notes: Add notes at beginning and end of each phase as work progresses
4. Sanity checks: Complete ALL sanity checks before moving to next phase
5. Ask before deviating: If unexpected issues arise, ask permission to deviate from plan
6. Use `tmp_scripts/`: Create any temporary scripts/tests/configs here to keep the repo tidy

## Context & Goal

The Quirkbot interviewer agent needs to take notes during interviews as it tries to discover quirky biographical facts about the interviewee. Instead of using separate JSON objects or tool calls, we will implement a simple inline note-taking system using special tags within the conversation utterances. The interviewer will write notes using `<note>...</note>` tags that can be parsed downstream. This allows the interviewer to maintain context and track discovered information while keeping the implementation simple.

## Phase 0: Create Interviewer System Prompt

**Goal**: Create a new function to generate the system prompt for the interviewer agent that includes note-taking instructions and examples.

### Developer Notes - Phase 0 Start

Starting implementation of interviewer system prompt with inline note-taking functionality.

### Tasks

- [x] Add `generate_interviewer_system_prompt()` function to `src/quirkbot.py`
- [x] Write clear instructions for the interviewer about taking notes using `<note>` tags
- [x] Include a concrete example showing how to naturally incorporate notes within conversation turns
- [x] Define guidelines for what should be noted (discovered facts, important context, follow-up topics)
- [x] Ensure the prompt instructs the interviewer to discover quirky biographical facts

### Sanity Checks - Phase 0

- [x] System prompt clearly explains the note-taking format with `<note>` tags
- [x] At least one concrete example of note-taking within a conversation turn is included
- [x] Instructions specify what types of information should be noted
- [x] The interviewer's goal of discovering quirky facts is clearly stated

### Developer Notes - Phase 0 End

Phase 0 completed successfully. Added `generate_interviewer_system_prompt()` function to `src/quirkbot.py` with comprehensive instructions for the interviewer agent. The prompt includes:
- Clear note-taking instructions using `<note>` tags
- Two concrete examples showing natural note integration
- Specific guidelines for marking "QUIRKY FACT DISCOVERED"
- Interview strategies and conversation style guidance
- Tested with validation script confirming all required elements present

## Phase 1: Integrate Interviewer into Chat Manager

**Goal**: Modify the chat manager to support the interviewer agent mode with the new note-taking system prompt.

### Developer Notes - Phase 1 Start

Starting integration of interviewer mode into the web application.

### Tasks

- [x] Add interviewer mode option to chat manager configuration
- [x] Implement logic to use interviewer system prompt when in interviewer mode
- [x] Ensure the interviewer agent can interact with Quirkbot personas
- [x] Preserve existing Quirkbot functionality for the interviewee side

### Sanity Checks - Phase 1

- [x] Chat manager can switch between normal mode and interviewer mode
- [x] Interviewer system prompt is correctly applied when in interviewer mode
- [x] Existing Quirkbot persona functionality remains intact
- [x] The system can handle conversations between interviewer and Quirkbot persona

### Developer Notes - Phase 1 End

Phase 1 completed successfully. Integration changes made:
- Added `/api/quirkbot/interviewer` endpoint to create interviewer sessions
- Modified message handling to apply system prompts for both quirkbot and interviewer sessions
- Updated both sync and streaming message endpoints to handle interviewer metadata
- Preserved existing Quirkbot functionality completely intact
- Created and ran integration test confirming all functionality works correctly
- Verified interviewer responses include `<note>` tags as expected

## Phase 2: Create Note Parser Utility

**Goal**: Build a utility function to extract and parse notes from conversation transcripts.

### Developer Notes - Phase 2 Start

Creating note parser utility module to extract and process notes from conversation transcripts.

### Tasks

- [x] Create `parse_notes_from_transcript()` function to extract all `<note>` content
- [x] Handle edge cases (unclosed tags, nested tags, malformed content)
- [x] Return structured data (list of notes with timestamps/turn numbers)
- [x] Add function to strip notes from utterances for clean display if needed

### Sanity Checks - Phase 2

- [x] Parser correctly extracts all notes from sample conversations
- [x] Edge cases are handled gracefully without crashes
- [x] Extracted notes preserve original formatting and content
- [x] Function can optionally return utterances with notes removed

### Developer Notes - Phase 2 End

Phase 2 completed successfully. Created `src/note_parser.py` with comprehensive note parsing utilities:
- `parse_notes_from_transcript()` - Extract notes from full conversation
- `extract_notes_from_text()` - Extract notes from single text
- `strip_notes_from_text()` - Remove notes for clean display
- `parse_notes_with_validation()` - Parse with error detection
- `format_notes_summary()` - Generate readable summary
- `get_quirky_facts()` - Extract only quirky fact discoveries
- All functions tested with comprehensive test suite - 6/6 tests passed
- Handles edge cases: unclosed tags, empty notes, nested tags

## Phase 3: Test and Validate

**Goal**: Create test scripts to validate the note-taking system works end-to-end.

### Developer Notes - Phase 3 Start

Starting end-to-end testing of the interviewer note-taking system.

### Tasks

- [x] Create test script in `tmp_scripts/` to simulate interviewer conversations
- [x] Generate sample conversations with note-taking
- [x] Verify notes are properly formatted and parseable
- [x] Test with multiple Quirkbot personas to ensure variety
- [x] Document any issues or edge cases discovered

### Sanity Checks - Phase 3

- [x] Test script successfully runs interviewer conversations
- [x] Notes appear naturally within conversation flow
- [x] Parser successfully extracts all notes from test conversations
- [x] Notes contain relevant information about discovered quirky facts
- [x] System handles at least 3 different personas successfully

### Developer Notes - Phase 3 End

Phase 3 completed successfully. Testing results:
- Created two test scripts: `test_interviewer_e2e.py` for API testing and `test_interview_simulation.py` for offline testing
- Simulated interview conversation with realistic note-taking patterns
- Successfully extracted 6 notes from 10-message conversation
- Identified 4 quirky facts with proper "QUIRKY FACT DISCOVERED" markers
- All validation checks passed (6/6 for note extraction, 5/5 for prompt configuration)
- Notes are properly formatted, parseable, and contain relevant interview insights
- System successfully tracks discovered facts and follow-up questions
- No edge cases or issues discovered - system working as designed

## Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup

**Goal**: Document the new feature and clean up any temporary files.

### Developer Notes - Phase 4 Start

Beginning documentation and cleanup tasks for the interviewer note-taking feature.

### Tasks

- [x] Update README if needed to mention interviewer mode
- [x] Add docstrings to all new functions
- [x] Create example usage snippet for the interviewer mode
- [x] Clean up any debugging code or temporary files
- [x] Ensure all code follows project conventions

### Sanity Checks - Phase 4

- Added Quirkbot interviewer section to README with API endpoint documentation
- Created `examples/interviewer_usage.py` with complete working example
- All functions have comprehensive docstrings (6/6 in note_parser.py, 1/1 new in quirkbot.py)
- Test scripts retained in `tmp_scripts/` for future development use
- Code follows project conventions (imports, formatting, structure)
- No debugging code in production files
- Python syntax validated for all new modules
